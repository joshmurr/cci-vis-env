This is a place to organise and write up the work and research for _Interactive and Visual Environments_, a module as part of the _Creative Computing MSc_ at [_CCI_](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute) in 2020.

What was originally meant to be a module about people in spaces turned into exploring _online environments_ thanks to the Corona Virus pandemic. I decided to focus on learning WebGL and attempting to make interactive (or not) visualisations taking advantage of what WebGL can offer - namely calculations on the GPU. This learning amounted in making a lightweight WebGL library which is currently called [__GL_BP__](https://github.com/joshmurr/webgl_boilerplate) (_WebGL Boilerplate_) which is an ongoing development and so subject to continual change, but has helped me learn the intricacies of WebGL.

This Github pages website and it's Jekyll theme has been a playground for me to learn some more general web skills as I try to get up to scratch with more modern web development techniques and practices.

Everything made by [Josh Murr](https://joshmur.github.io/)
