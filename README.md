## [Project Log][log]

---

This is a [project log][log] for my final project for _Interactive and Visual Environments_ while studying at at [_CCI_](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute) in 2020.

The _Vis-Env_ module turned into a _**Online** Interactive and Visual Environments_ module as the Corona Virus pandemic took over, so I took it as a sign that now is the time to learn some web development skillz. The project focus is on making nice interactions and visualisations with WebGL, but around that I'm learning some basic, but more modern Javascript and CSS; Websockets; and generally how to get things working on the internet.. So this [project log][log] is also a little platform for me to try out some new things by making a simple Jekyll theme and as a place to show some experiments along the way.
